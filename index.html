				<p>
					Systems autonomy will come from re-contextualization, repetition, while maintaining integrity of the original system, allowing it to be “contained” and replicated for the sake of convenience. 
					<br><br>
					Synthetics is an evaluation of the inherited systems (language) that dictate function in an era of rapid globalization, addressing how various artists and designers are dealing with the external (commercial) and internal (personal) parameters that these systems establish, while considering the historical context that has shaped their construction and deconstruction.
